My FreeCodeCamp Journey

This repository serves as a personal journal of my progress and learning experience with FreeCodeCamp. Rather than being a traditional app or project, it’s a space where I document everything I’ve learned, including the code solutions I’ve developed along the way. I’ve also set up a wiki to add more detailed information and context, making it easier for visitors to explore my work.

You’ll find my code organized in the repository directories, while additional details and explanations can be found in the wiki section.

I aim to keep this repository updated, but please note that the code reflects my original solutions at the time I completed the challenges. I’ve intentionally left the code as it was, without revising it using more advanced techniques that I may have learned since then. This way, the solutions remain authentic to my learning journey unless FreeCodeCamp updates the challenges and requires adjustments.

If you're also part of FreeCodeCamp or just interested in what I’m doing, feel free to reach out! I’ve made this repository public as a reference and resource for others, so I welcome feedback. Should you come across a solution that no longer works, please open an issue and I’ll look into it. While I’m not accepting alternative code solutions for this repository, contributions like typo fixes, better explanations, or improved examples are very welcome.

If you find this helpful, feel free to follow the repository, star it, or share it with others.

For contributions like typo corrections or other improvements, please check out the guidelines on contributing to the repository.
