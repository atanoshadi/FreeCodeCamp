# My FreeCodeCamp Journey #
This repository serves as a personal journal of my progress and learning experience with FreeCodeCamp. Rather than being a traditional app or project, including the code solutions I’ve developed along the way.

You’ll find my code organized in the repository directories.

If you find this helpful, feel free to follow the repository, star it, or share it with others.
